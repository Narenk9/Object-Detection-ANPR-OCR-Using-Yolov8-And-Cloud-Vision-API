the real struggle is when there is no one to tell you / advise you where 
you are doing the mistakes. No one to help me with ultralytics docs/ dependency
 issues, docker issues , file directory issues. no structured explaination
 always looking to 
1. So the problem faced was as I am using Google's api and 
a lot of packages and putting them into the requirements file 
made the installation much more longer and making the image size around 9GB
solution :  https://jpetazzo.github.io/2013/12/01/docker-python-pip-requirements/
Used multi staging approach
2.  when I was deciding whether to use Yolo V9 or V8  there were a 
lot of dependence issues and compatibility issues as well compared to Yolo V8 

3. I was able to reduce the size due to 
the downloading the package on runtime using os
https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/8465

Reduced the file from 8Gb to x

4. Since streamlit reruns the app with each user interaction, 
are python packages being reimported every time as well?
